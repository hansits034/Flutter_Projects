# My First Flutter Project: A Beginner's Journey (Responsive Website With Flutter)

This repository documents my very first attempt at building a mobile application using Flutter. The entire project was created by following a tutorial on YouTube.

## The Challenge

The goal was to complete a 3-hour Flutter tutorial to get a hands-on introduction to the framework. The tutorial covered the basics of setting up a project, building a user interface, and handling basic logic.

## My Learning Journey üê¢

While the tutorial itself was only 3 hours long, my journey to complete it took **3 days**.

This extra time was spent:
- Pausing and re-watching sections to fully grasp new concepts.
- Debugging small typos and errors that every beginner makes.
- Experimenting with the code to see how different widgets worked.
- Taking breaks to let the information sink in!

This project taught me that development is more than just copying code; it's about understanding the 'why' behind it. It was a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience, and I'm proud of this small first step.
